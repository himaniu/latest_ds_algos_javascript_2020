/*
Program to check Strength of Password. A password is said to be strong if it satisfies the following criteria: It contains at least one lowercase English character.
 It contains at least one uppercase English character.
 It contains at least one special character. The special characters
 are: !@#$%^&*(
 Its length is at least 8.
 It contains at least one digit.
 Given a string, find its strength. Let a strong password is
 one that satisfies all above conditions. A moderate password is one
 that satisfies first three conditions and has length at
 least 6. Otherwise password is week.
 Input : "gfg!@12"
 Output : Moderate
 Input : â€œSapientGlobalMarkets!@12"
 Output : Strong
